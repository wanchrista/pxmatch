## Features of Web Application
This application allows general practitioners to refer their patients to specialized doctors, thus reducing paper use as well as lost referrals. 

Search by physician name or specialty. Px will filter and display all relevant physicians based on your input and preferences. Our system offers two methods of searching. 

1. By selecting search by physician, you can search for a specific specialist. 

2. By selecting search by specialty, you can search for individuals that meet criteria you set.
